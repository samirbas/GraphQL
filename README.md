The objective of this project is to learn the GraphQL query language, by creating your own profile page.

You'll use the GraphQL endpoint which is provided by the platform (https://zone01normandie.org/api/graphql-engine/v1/graphql). You'll be able to query your own data to populate your profile page.

So that you can access your data, you'll need to create a login page.

Your profile must display three pieces of information which you may choose. For example:

Basic user identification
XP amount
grades
audits
skills
